# VCNL36687 Arduino library
Arduino library for the VCNL36687 proximity sensor

## Sensor description
VCNL36687S by Vishay Intertechnology, Inc is a fully integrated proximity sensor that combines a high power vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), a photodiode, a signal processing IC, and a 12-bit ADC in a single package. The new VCNL36687S is designed to be used in smartphones, tablets, virtual reality / augmented reality (VR / AR) headsets and other battery-operated devices.

Through its standard I2C bus serial digital interface, the VCNL36687S allows easy access to the proximity signal. Its programmable interrupt function offers wake-up functionality for the microcontroller when a proximity change occurs, which reduces processing overhead by eliminating the need for continuous polling.

Compared to previous generation devices, the VCNL36687S requires less energy to carry out the same functionality; with a 20 mA pulse current, the VCNL36687S can detect a Kodak Gray Card at a distance of 20 cm, where previous VCNL series devices required 200 mA of current.
